## Urgent update point
- [X] Implement indentation for nested printing
  * Example: a class with an inner class
  * or a list of lists
  * or a dictionary of dictionaries
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Another urgent update point
- [X] Implement a class for Tuples
  * The datatype will have a minimum of one value
  * And a maximum of six values
  * The model used is available in this [link](https://medium.com/@mgm06bm/tuples-in-java-17-c911c9431ed9)

## First point
- [ ] Implement the *Read* Class
  * The skeleton is already done
  * The focus is on the *Controller* Class for it
- [ ] Implement the ***Singleton* project pattern** for both write, read, append and read&write classes
- [ ] Verify if the ***Mediator* project pattern** is working correctly throughout the project

## Second point
- [ ] Create the *ReadWrite* Class
  * It's an implementation of the Append Class where the caret stays at the beginning of the opened file, instead of at the end
</article>

## Third point
- [ ] Integrate *File* Class with *BonfileObject* Class
- [ ] Attach both Classes in *Write* & *Read* Classes
  * (*Append* & *ReadWrite* included)
<br>
<br>
<br>
</article>

## Fourth point
- [ ] Optimize code
  * The *Append* Class shares same methods with *Read* and *Write* Classes
  * The *ReadWrite* Class is, as written before, just another implementation of the *Append* Class

## Last point
- [ ] Remove the main method of the *Bonfile* Class
- [ ] Create another methods to converge everything
- [ ] Export as a .jar file and test
  * if everything is doing good, upload to GitHub
  * But before uploading, do not forget to create a readme file
